# spiders

Two spiders: One captures the data from Chinses forum CSDN and another gains data from Chinese online shopping website JD. 

For each spider, you should set up a database named spider in the local and run models.py to create tables.  

Then you can run spider.py to get the data.  

For the JD spider, I use selenium tool to help me analyse the dynamic page so that I can get the data I want.
